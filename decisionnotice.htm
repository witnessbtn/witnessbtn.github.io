The Commissioner’s decision is that the DfE has incorrectly applied regulation 12(5)(e) (commercial interests) to the amount of deposit paid for the site. The Commissioner requires the public authority to take the following steps ensure compliance with the legislation: Provide the complainant with the monetary figure of the 10% deposit paid for the Bowring site.

The Home Office disclosed some information about a particular MOU and also certain import/export licences. It withheld the remaining information in connection with the MOU under the exemptions at sections 24(1) (national security) and 27(1)(a) (international relations), and it withheld information about the import/export licenses under section 43(2) (commercial interests) of the FOIA. It also refused to confirm or deny whether it held any other information falling within scope of the request, citing section 27(4)(a) and (b) (international relations) of the FOIA.&nbsp; The Commissioner?s decision is that the Home Office was entitled to rely on the exemption at section 27(1)(a) of the FOIA to withhold information about the MOU. It was also entitled to rely on section 27(4) to neither confirm nor deny whether it held further information. However, the Home Office did not apply the section 43(2) exemption correctly. It also breached section 10(1) by failing to comply with section 1(1) within the time for compliance, and section 17(1) by failing to provide a refusal notice within the time for compliance.

He then made a request for the meta data relating to that request and has also requested documents relating to programmes aired by the BBC (FCO ref 0547-16 and 0548-16). The FCO has disclosed information in relation to one programme detailed in the first request and stated that it holds no information falling within the scope of the request as it relates to the other programme. It had refused both subsequent requests citing section 14(1) FOIA. During the course of the Commissioner?s investigation, it withdrew its reliance on section 14 for both requests, disclosed the information in relation to 0547-16 and, following an extension of the public interest test, sought to withhold the information within the scope of 0548-16 on the basis of section 36 FOIA. The Commissioner?s decision is that in relation to the request under reference 1135-15 the FCO failed to disclose the requested information within the statutory time frame of 20 working days and has breached section 10 FOIA. It is her position that on the balance of probabilities the FCO has disclosed all of the information it holds within the scope of this request. In relation to the request held under 0548-16, the Commissioner?s decision is that having relied on section 14 initially, the refusal notice was issued in accordance with FOIA section 17(5) but that having withdrawn its reliance on section 14 and then excessively extending its public interest test considerations, the FCO breached section 17(3). During the course of the investigation, the FCO disclosed the information requested under reference 0547-16, but as this was disclosed outside of the statutory time frame, the Commissioner considers that the FCO has again breached section 10 FOIA.</p><p class="text-small"><span class="dn-decision dn-decision-notupheld">FOI 1:<span>Not upheld</span></span><span class="dn-decision dn-decision-upheld">FOI 10:<span>Upheld</span></span><span class="dn-decision dn-decision-upheld">FOI 17:<span>Upheld</span></span></p></div></div><aside class="aside-further"><ul><li><a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/decision-notices/2017/2014497/fs50641158.pdf" class="theme-action" target="_blank"><h3 class="h4">Decision notice FS50641158</h3><div class="text-small"><p>PDF</p></div><span class="icon-file-pdf"><!-- required for FF3 and Opera --></span></a></li></ul></aside></li><li><div class="itemlink theme-action clearfix"><div class="itemlink-content"><h2 class="h3">National Archives</h2><p class="text-small">17 July 2017, Central government</p> <p>The complainant has requested from The National Archives (TNA) a closed extract with TNA?s reference PREM/3/139/11B/1, from the open parent file PREM/3/139/11B ?

The Cabinet Office?s position was based on a case of mistaken identity with the complainant and a previous requester with a similar name. Once this mistake had been pointed out, the Cabinet Office refused the request under section 35(1)(a) of the Act as the information related to the development of government policy, and the balance of the public interest favoured maintaining the exemption. The Commissioner?s decision is that section 35(1)(a) of the Act applies, but that the public interest test favours disclosure of the withheld information.

The Commissioner accepts that there is a political dimension to the shortlisting process.

During the Commissioner?s investigation, the Cabinet Office denied holding information for another part of the request, and for the others cited further exemptions: Section 35(1)(a) ? for the information in its entirety; Section 35(1)(b) ? for the specific correspondence which was communication between ministers; Section 36(2)(c) ? should the Commissioner find that section 35 did not apply; Section 41(1) ? for the correspondence concerning Jack Straw MP.

The Commissioner?s decision regarding section 35(1)(a) is that the exemption is engaged for the information in its entirety, and that the balance of the public interest test favours maintaining the exemption.

In the government?s view, such arrangements were not within the spirit of the relevant rules and were providing a competitive advantage for employers by reducing their tax and national insurance liability. The Commissioner concluded that the public authority was not entitled to withhold all of the information held within the scope of the request on the basis of the exemption contained at section 35(1) FOIA. She also concluded the public authority was entitled to withhold some of the information in scope on the basis of the exemptions contained at sections 31(1)(1)(d) and 40(2) FOIA.

Under section 11 he expressed a preference to have the information communicated in a particular format. The DH advised the complainant that the PFU unit no longer existed but ultimately identified two individuals who it said most closely fulfilled the roles referred to in the request and responded to the request on that basis. The DH did not provide the diaries, it said that it did not hold any relevant minutes and although it provided some email correspondence, it redacted information from those emails under section 40(2) ? personal information and section 43(2) - commercial interests. At the internal review stage the DH applied section 12 to refuse the request in its entirety and during the Commissioner?s investigation it also applied section 14(1) on the basis that the request was vexatious due to it being burdensome. The Complainant has also raised concerns over the quality of the refusal notice issued under section 17 and the level of advice and assistance provided under section 16. The Commissioner?s decision is that the DH is not entitled to rely on sections 12 or 14 to refuse the request. That it is entitled to refuse to provide requested information in the complainant?s preferred format under section 11(2) because of the costs involved in doing so. In respect of the information redacted from the email correspondence initially disclosed to the complainant, the Commissioner finds that the exemptions provided by sections 40(2) and 43 are only partly engaged. The Commissioner finds that there have been no breaches of section 17 or 16. In respect of the diary information the Commissioner requires the public authority to issue a fresh response in accordance with the FOIA without relying the procedural exemptions provided by section 12 or 14(1). In respect of the information withheld from the emails the DH is required to provide the information which does not attract the exemptions provided by sections 40(2) and 43.

The Commissioner has initially had to decide how the requests under consideration should be interpreted and has found that they only cover the business information submitted to the DfE by the Weald of Kent. The DfE considered that this fell within the ?prejudice to the effective conduct of public affairs? exemption to disclosure in section 36(2)(c) of FOIA. The Commissioner has determined the exemption is engaged but concluded that on balance the public interest favours disclosure.

The Commissioner requires the public authority to issue a fresh response under FOIA which does not rely on section 12, providing appropriate advice and assistance as necessary.</p><p class="text-small"><span class="dn-decision dn-decision-upheld">FOI 10:<span>Upheld</span></span><span class="dn-decision dn-decision-upheld">FOI 12:<span>Upheld</span></span><span class="dn-decision dn-decision-upheld">FOI 16:<span>Upheld</span></span></p></div></div><aside class="aside-further"><ul><li><a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/decision-notices/2016/1625028/fs_50622623.pdf" class="theme-action" target="_blank"><h3 class="h4">Decision notice FS50622623</h3><div class="text-small"><p>PDF</p></div><span class="icon-file-pdf"><!-- required for FF3 and Opera --></span></a></li></ul></aside></li><li><div class="itemlink theme-action clearfix"><div class="itemlink-content"><h2 class="h3">Department for Education</h2><p class="text-small">8 September 2016, Central government</p> <p>The complainant requested from the Education Funding Agency (?EFA?) information about the redevelopment of Chagford Primary School (?CPS?). The EFA provided some information but withheld other information under sections 40(2) and 43(2). The Commissioner?s decision is that the EFA correctly applied section 43(2) to the information that it withheld, that it complied with section 1, as it holds no further information falling within the scope of complainant?s request, and that it complied with section 10(1), by responding promptly to the request. However, she has decided that the EFA breached section 10(3), by taking more than a reasonable time to carry out the public interest test in relation to section 43(2), and breached section 17(1), by failing to state within 20 working days of receipt of the request that it was applying section 40(2) to some information. The Commissioner does not require the EFA to take any further steps to ensure compliance with the legislation. As an executive agency of the Department for Education (?DfE?), the EFA does not constitute a public authority for the purposes of FOIA and so this notice is issued to its parent Department, the DfE.</p><p class="text-small"><span class="dn-decision dn-decision-notupheld">FOI 1:<span>Not upheld</span></span><span class="dn-decision dn-decision-partlyupheld">FOI 10:<span>Partly upheld</span></span><span class="dn-decision dn-decision-upheld">FOI 17:<span>Upheld</span></span><span class="dn-decision dn-decision-notupheld">FOI 43:<span>Not upheld</span></span></p></div></div><aside class="aside-further"><ul><li><a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/decision-notices/2016/1624985/fs50613094.pdf" class="theme-action" target="_blank"><h3 class="h4">Decision notice FS50613094</h3><div class="text-small"><p>PDF</p></div><span class="icon-file-pdf"><!-- required for FF3 and Opera --></span></a></li></ul></aside></li><li><div class="itemlink theme-action clearfix"><div class="itemlink-content"><h2 class="h3">Cabinet Office</h2><p class="text-small">8 September 2016, Central government</p> <p>The complainant made a request under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (the Act) regarding permanent secretaries.

On 21 July 2015 the Commissioner issued a decision notice under the reference FS50566201 in which he found that the DfE had correctly applied the exemptions to disclosure set out at section 35(1)(b) (ministerial communications) and sections 36(2)(b)(i) and (ii) (prejudice to the effective conduct of public affairs) of FOIA. Referencing the passage of time that had elapsed since that decision, the complainant in this case has made a further request for the withheld information. With the exception of some information which has been disclosed, the DfE considered that the requested information continued to be exempt information under the exemptions previously cited but also stated that section 36(2)(c) of FOIA applied to parts of the requested information. With respect to each of the exemptions cited, the DfE exercised the public interest test and concluded that the public interest still favoured withholding the information. The Commissioner has decided that section 35(1)(b) and, elsewhere, sections 36(2)(b)(i) and (ii) are engaged but not section 36(2)(c) of FOIA. For each of the exemptions that have been found to apply, the Commissioner has determined that, in all the circumstances, the public interest in disclosure outweighs the public interest in favour of maintaining the exemptions. The Commissioner therefore requires the DfE to disclose the requested information with the exception of any information that the DfE considers should be withheld in accordance with its standard policy on the publication of personal data (see paragraph 6).

If the FCO decides to withhold any information then the complainant should be provided with a refusal notice giving a full explanation as to why the information will not be disclosed, including details of any public interest test consideration.</p><p class="text-small"><span class="dn-decision dn-decision-upheld">FOI 17:<span>Upheld</span></span></p></div></div><aside class="aside-further"><ul><li><a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/decision-notices/2016/1623809/fs50614967.pdf" class="theme-action" target="_blank"><h3 class="h4">Decision notice FS50614967</h3><div class="text-small"><p>PDF</p></div><span class="icon-file-pdf"><!-- required for FF3 and Opera --></span></a></li></ul></aside></li><li><div class="itemlink theme-action clearfix"><div class="itemlink-content"><h2 class="h3">Ministry of Justice</h2><p class="text-small">21 March 2016, Central government</p> <p>The complainant requested information relating to the pay and grading of psychologists employed by the prison service including those in the psychology department at HMP Wakefield.

The Home Office disclosed some information, but applied a restrictive reading to one part of the request and cited the following exemptions when withholding information from a document within the scope of another part of the request: 31(1)(e) (prejudice to the immigration controls), 36(2)(c) (prejudice to the effective conduct of public affairs), 40(2) (personal information). It also withheld some of the content of that document on the grounds that it was not within the scope of the request. The Commissioner?s decision is that the Home Office misread one part of the request and also failed to identify all the information it held that was within the scope of other parts of the request. In so doing it breached section 1(1)(a) of the FOIA. It is now required to provide a fresh response to those parts of the request. In relation to the document from which some of the content was withheld, the Commissioner finds that its entire content is within the scope of the request and that the Home Office breached section 1(1)(a) when withholding information on the basis that it was not within scope. In relation to the exemptions cited, the Commissioner finds that section 31(1)(e) was not engaged, but that sections 36(2)(c) and 40(2) were engaged and properly relied on. The Home Office is now required to disclose the information in relation to which section 31(1)(e) has been found not engaged. In relation to the parts of this document which the Commissioner has now found were in scope, the Home Office is required to issue a fresh response. The Commissioner requires the Home Office to take the following steps to ensure compliance with the legislation. Provide a fresh response to request (4); Provide a fresh response in respect of the document within the scope of requests (7) and (8) that the Commissioner has now found to be fully within scope; Provide a fresh response in relation to any further information it holds that is within the scope of requests (7) and (8), in line with the description given in paragraph 28 below.

The DfT withheld the information under section 37(1)(aa) ? Communications with the heir to the throne, section 40(2) ? personal information and 41 ? information provided in confidence. It also explained that if the information was deemed to be environmental information and fall within the scope of the EIR it would be exempt under regulations 12(4)(e) ? internal communications and 13 ? personal information. The Commissioner?s decision is that the majority of the information constitutes environmental information and so should have been dealt with under the EIR. In respect of that information the Commissioner finds that the exception provided by regulation 12(4)(e) cannot be maintained in the public interest. However a small amount of the withheld environmental information is exempt under regulation 13. The DfT was correct to deal with the remaining information under FOIA and the Commissioner finds that information is exempt under section 37(1)(aa). The Commissioner requires the public authority to disclose the environmental information that is not protected by regulation 13, as set out in the confidential annex that accompanies this notice. The public authority must take these steps within 35 calendar days of the date of this decision notice. Failure to comply may result in the Commissioner making written certification of this fact to the High Court pursuant to section 54 of the Act and may be dealt with as a contempt of court.</p><p class="text-small"><span class="dn-decision dn-decision-notupheld">FOI 37:<span>Not upheld</span></span><span class="dn-decision dn-decision-upheld">EIR 12(4)(e):<span>Upheld</span></span><span class="dn-decision dn-decision-notupheld">EIR 13:<span>Not upheld</span></span></p></div></div><aside class="aside-further"><ul><li><a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/decision-notices/2015/1560679/fer_0567018.pdf" class="theme-action" target="_blank"><h3 class="h4">Decision notice FER0567018</h3><div class="text-small"><p>PDF</p></div><span class="icon-file-pdf"><!-- required for FF3 and Opera --></span></a></li></ul></aside></li><li><div class="itemlink theme-action clearfix"><div class="itemlink-content"><h2 class="h3">Department for Communities and Local Government</h2><p class="text-small">19 October 2015, Central government</p> <p>The complainant has requested information relating to storage grants for prisoners.

DEFRA identified that the information described in the request spanned two access regimes, the FOIA and the EIR. It refused to comply with the request on the basis that to do so would exceed the appropriate limit under section 12(1) of the FOIA; and, to the extent that it also sought access to environmental information, responding to the request would also be manifestly unreasonable under regulation 12(4)(b) of the EIR. The Information Commissioner?s decision is that complying with the request would exceed the appropriate cost limit under section 12(1) of the FOIA for some of the information. In relation to the information which constitutes environmental information, it is also a manifestly unreasonable request by virtue of cost under regulation 12(4)(b) of the EIR and the public interest favours maintaining the exception.

He therefore requires the public authority to take the step detailed in paragraph 3. The MOJ also breached section 10 of FOIA by failing to respond to the request within 20 working days. The Commissioner requires the public authority issue a fresh response to the request set out in paragraph 5 of this notice. The public authority must take these steps within 35 calendar days of the date of this decision notice. Failure to comply may result in the Commissioner making written certification of this fact to the High Court pursuant to section 54 of the Act and may be dealt with as a contempt of court.</p><p class="text-small"><span class="dn-decision dn-decision-upheld">FOI 10:<span>Upheld</span></span><span class="dn-decision dn-decision-upheld">FOI 12:<span>Upheld</span></span></p></div></div><aside class="aside-further"><ul><li><a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/decision-notices/2015/1432197/fs_50578923.pdf" class="theme-action" target="_blank"><h3 class="h4">Decision notice FS50578923</h3><div class="text-small"><p>PDF</p></div><span class="icon-file-pdf"><!-- required for FF3 and Opera --></span></a></li></ul></aside></li><li><div class="itemlink theme-action clearfix"><div class="itemlink-content"><h2 class="h3">Ministry of Justice</h2><p class="text-small">23 July 2015, Central government</p> <p>The complainant requested information about oral hearings for prisoners from the Ministry of Justice (the ?MOJ?) who provided some of the information requested, but withheld the remainder under section 40(2) of the FOIA, the exemption for personal information.

The Commissioner?s decision is that section 41(1) was not engaged and that section 43(2) was engaged, but that the public interest in the maintenance of the exemption did not outweigh the public interest in disclosure of the information. The Commissioner has also proactively considered section 40(2) (personal information) and found this engaged in relation to a small amount of the content of the reports. The Home Office is now required to disclose the reports with the minor content in relation to which section 40(2) is engaged redacted.

Secondly, and subject to the above, if the information is held the public authority must either disclose the requested information or, if it wishes to withhold any information, issue a refusal notice in relation to the information it wishes to withhold and disclose the remainder.</p><p class="text-small"><span class="dn-decision dn-decision-upheld">FOI 1:<span>Upheld</span></span><span class="dn-decision dn-decision-upheld">FOI 10:<span>Upheld</span></span></p></div></div><aside class="aside-further"><ul><li><a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/decision-notices/2015/1424140/fs_50573317.pdf" class="theme-action" target="_blank"><h3 class="h4">Decision notice FS50573317</h3><div class="text-small"><p>PDF</p></div><span class="icon-file-pdf"><!-- required for FF3 and Opera --></span></a></li></ul></aside></li><li><div class="itemlink theme-action clearfix"><div class="itemlink-content"><h2 class="h3">Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs</h2><p class="text-small">9 April 2015, Central government</p> <p>The complainant has made a number of requests to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) for information relating to the first wave of the pilot badger culls in West Somerset and West Gloucestershire. Defra responded by providing some parts of the requested information, withholding other parts or otherwise explaining that the requested information was not held. The present notice refers to Defra?s refusal to disclose the costs associated with the purchasing of badger cage traps under the ?confidentiality of commercial or industrial information?

  The Commissioner did not uphold HO?s application of the section 43(2) and section 41(1) FOIA exemptions to the performance information held and also to the performance points information held except that which would make public parts of the business models used by HO and its contractors. He did however uphold HO?s application of the section 43 FOIA exemption to information the disclosure of which would reveal parts of the business models used by HO and its contractors. He also decided that the balance of the public interest favoured maintaining the exemption for this information. The Commissioner also decided that a small amount of information should be redacted from the information to be disclosed where not doing so would disclose personal information proper to be withheld under the section 40(2) FOIA exemption.   
  For the avoidance of doubt the Commissioner set out his decision in detail in a confidential schedule which has been provided to HO only. HO provided the Commissioner, for the purposes of his investigation, with the requested information for three IRCs - those at Colnbrook, Brook House and Yarl?s Wood - for him to consider as a ?test case? which he has done. He now requires HO to apply disclosure principles set out in this Decision Notice to the corresponding information held by HO for its other IRCs, whether publicly or privately operated. The Commissioner requires HO to disclose to the complainant the performance information and the performance points information specified in the confidential schedule to this decision. Also, to apply the same principles to the corresponding information held about other IRCs but which HO did not provide to the Commissioner for his consideration.</p><p class="text-small"><span class="dn-decision dn-decision-upheld">FOI 41:<span>Upheld</span></span><span class="dn-decision dn-decision-partlyupheld">FOI 43:<span>Partly upheld</span></span></p></div></div><aside class="aside-further"><ul><li><a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/decision-notices/2015/1043688/fs_50553359.pdf" class="theme-action" target="_blank"><h3 class="h4">Decision notice FS50533359</h3><div class="text-small"><p>PDF</p></div><span class="icon-file-pdf"><!-- required for FF3 and Opera --></span></a></li></ul></aside></li><li><div class="itemlink theme-action clearfix"><div class="itemlink-content"><h2 class="h3">Cabinet Office</h2><p class="text-small">8 April 2015, Central government</p> <p>The complainant has requested information relating to the Cabinet Office?s work with the Behavioural Insights Team.

Where the section 42(1) is engaged the Commissioner finds that the public interest favours maintaining the exemption.

The Commissioner?s decision is as follows: The Home Office does not hold any further information falling within the scope of the requests beyond that previously disclosed or withheld on the basis of exemptions; the minutes from the working group falling within the scope of request 1 are not exempt from disclosure on the basis of section 40(2) of FOIA; the information the Home Office holds falling within the scope of request 3 is exempt from disclosure on the basis of section 40(2) of FOIA; the Home Office did not breach any requirements of FOIA by disclosing information at the internal review stage rather than when it initially responded to the request. However, the Home Office did breach sections 1(1)(b) and 10(1) of FOIA by failing to disclose an unredacted copy of the minutes from the working group. The Commissioner requires the public authority to provide the complainant with an unredacted copy of the minutes from the working group.</p><p class="text-small"><span class="dn-decision dn-decision-partlyupheld">FOI 1:<span>Partly upheld</span></span><span class="dn-decision dn-decision-upheld">FOI 10:<span>Upheld</span></span></p></div></div><aside class="aside-further"><ul><li><a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/decision-notices/2014/987614/fs_50519143.pdf" class="theme-action" target="_blank"><h3 class="h4">Decision notice FS50519143</h3><div class="text-small"><p>PDF</p></div><span class="icon-file-pdf"><!-- required for FF3 and Opera --></span></a></li></ul></aside></li><li><div class="itemlink theme-action clearfix"><div class="itemlink-content"><h2 class="h3">Ministry of Justice</h2><p class="text-small">20 May 2014, Central government</p> <p>The complainant requested information about a sentencing report in relation to a conviction in 2009.

The complainant disputes BIS? application of all the exemptions and also argues that it should have provided a more specific indication as to how the exemptions had been applied to each redacted piece of information or withheld document. The Commissioner?s decision is that: the section 27(1)(a) exemption is engaged and the public interest favours withholding the information; section 35(1)(a) is engaged but the public interest favours disclosure; section 40(2) is engaged; section 42 is engaged and the public interest favours withholding the information; and that BIS breached section 17(1)(b) by failing to specify which exemption had been applied to each redaction or withheld document. The Commissioner requires the public authority to: where information has been withheld solely on the basis of section 35(1)(a), BIS must provide the complainant with a copy of the information; information redacted or withheld on the basis of section 40(2) should only continue to be withheld if it is genuinely personal data, as described in paragraph 100 below; in order to comply with section 17(1)(b) BIS must now provide the complainant with a list specifying under what exemptions(s) information has been withheld.

The request for information included details of the number of animals involved, the dates of the movement and the outbound postcode of the originating and destination premises. DEFRA sought to rely upon section 40(2) of the FOIA. It stated that some of the requested information was personal data and that its release would infringe the Data Protection Principles as its release would be unfair. In respect of information relating to commercial enterprises it advised that it was not able to separately identify this information without manually going through 178,000 data entries. The Commissioner?s decision is that the exemption at section 40(2) is engaged in relation to the information that has been requested in so far as it relates to the information of individuals or sole traders. Further, that DEFRA has incorrectly applied section 40(2) to the information which concerns commercial enterprises. In failing to disclose the non- personal information to the complainant it has breached section 1(1)(b) and section 10 of the FOIA.

The FCO withheld some of the documents in their entirety and disclosed digests of the remaining documents, albeit with material it considered to be exempt from disclosure redacted. In total, the FCO cited eight separate exemptions, namely: sections 27(1)(a) and 27(2) (international relations); section 35(1)(a) (government policy); section 36(2) (effective conduct of public affairs); section 40(2) (personal data); section 41(1) (information provided in confidence); section 42(1) (legal professional privilege); and section 43(2) (commercial interests). The complainant disputes the application of all the exemptions with the exception of section 40(2). The complainant also argued that the FCO should have provided a more specific indication as how the exemptions had been applied to each particular redaction. The Commissioner?s decision is as follows: The exemptions contained at sections 27(1)(a), 27(2) and 42(1) are engaged and the public interest for each exemption favours upholding the exemption in question. The exemption at section 35(1)(a) is engaged but the public interest favours disclosing the information. The exemptions contained at sections 36(2), 41(1) and 43(2) are not engaged.

The Commissioner?s decision is that section 36(2)(c) does not apply to the information withheld by the DfE as the public interest in withholding the information does not outweigh the public interest in disclosure.

The MoJ provided the complainant with the majority of information requested but withheld some material on the basis of section 23(1) (security bodies); section 35(1)(a) (government policy); section 35(1)(b) (Ministerial communications); section 38(1)(b) (health and safety); section 42(1) (legal professional privilege) and section 40(2) (personal data). The complainant disputed the application of all of the exemptions with the exception of sections 23(1) and 40(2). The Commissioner has concluded that the section 42(1) has been correctly applied and the public interest favours maintaining that exemption. However, although he has found that section 35(1)(a) is engaged, he has concluded that the public interest favours disclosing the information withheld under this exemption. The Commissioner has also concluded that sections 35(1)(b) and 38(1)(b) are not engaged.

In relation to the remaining requests the Home Office either provided information it did hold, or explained that no information was held.

In the request the complainant referred to a number of lawsuits which had been heard in court regarding the issue. HMRC interpreted the request to mean the complainant required the actual total VAT paid by the specific investment fund companies and investment trusts involved in the litigation. It refused this information under section 44(1)(a). It also explained it did not hold a general figure relating to VAT paid on fund administration and accounting fees not related to the investment funds and trusts specified in the request. The Commissioner began his investigation on the basis of HMRC?s interpretation of the request. However during the course of that investigation it became clear that the complainant required an estimated total VAT liability figure in the light of the precedent set by the listed court cases. He did not require the VAT figure directly involved in the litigation. Once the different interpretation of the request was confirmed with HMRC, it responded to this clarified request as a new request. The Commissioner?s decision is that both the complainant?s and HMRC?s interpretation of the request were valid interpretations. To the extent that HMRC did not confirm whether it held the information required in the complainant?s objective reading of the request within the required time for compliance, the Commissioner finds HMRC to be in breach of section 1(1)(a) of the FOIA. However, once it was informed of the complainant?s interpretation of the request, HMRC correctly responded to it as a new request. The Commissioner therefore does not require any further steps to be taken.</p><p class="text-small"><span class="dn-decision dn-decision-upheld">FOI 1:<span>Upheld</span></span></p></div></div><aside class="aside-further"><ul><li><a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/decision-notices/2013/900086/fs_50487149.pdf" class="theme-action" target="_blank"><h3 class="h4">Decision notice FS50487149</h3><div class="text-small"><p>PDF</p></div><span class="icon-file-pdf"><!-- required for FF3 and Opera --></span></a></li></ul></aside></li><li><div class="itemlink theme-action clearfix"><div class="itemlink-content"><h2 class="h3">Cabinet Office</h2><p class="text-small">4 September 2013, Central government</p> <p>The complainant submitted a request for information to the Cabinet Office relating to Lady Thatcher?s funeral.

The Department of Energy and Climate Change (?DECC?) initially refused the request under the FOIA. After reviewing the details of the case and the content of the withheld information the Commissioner advised that the withheld information falls within the scope of the EIRs. DECC continued to refute this, however the Commissioner maintains that the withheld information constitutes environmental information, and has assessed this case under the EIRs. DECC refused to disclose the requested information and cited the exception provided by regulation 12(4)(e) (internal communications) and 12(4)(d) (material still in the course of completion). The Commissioner?s decision is as follows: Regulation 12(4)(d) is not engaged; Regulation 12(4)(e) is engaged for some of the withheld information, but the public interest in disclosure of the information outweighs the public interest in maintaining the exception. The Commissioner requires the public authority to redact the personal data of the requester from the withheld information and to disclose the information withheld under regulations 12(4)(d) and 12(4)(e).</p><p class="text-small"><span class="dn-decision dn-decision-upheld">EIR 12(4)(d):<span>Upheld</span></span><span class="dn-decision dn-decision-partlyupheld">EIR 12(4)(e):<span>Partly upheld</span></span></p></div></div><aside class="aside-further"><ul><li><a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/decision-notices/2013/874032/fs_50478517.pdf" class="theme-action" target="_blank"><h3 class="h4">Decision notice FS50478517</h3><div class="text-small"><p>PDF</p></div><span class="icon-file-pdf"><!-- required for FF3 and Opera --></span></a></li></ul></aside></li><li><div class="itemlink theme-action clearfix"><div class="itemlink-content"><h2 class="h3">Home Office</h2><p class="text-small">17 June 2013, Central government</p> <p>The complainant requested submissions to Home Office Ministers regarding the proposed filtering mechanism set out in the draft Communications Data Bill.

The Commissioner has also found that in relation to the information that came to light during his investigation, this information is within the scope of the requests and the Cabinet Office was incorrect to state otherwise.</p><p class="text-small"><span class="dn-decision dn-decision-notupheld">FOI 36:<span>Not upheld</span></span><span class="dn-decision dn-decision-upheld">FOI 43:<span>Upheld</span></span></p></div></div><aside class="aside-further"><ul><li><a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/decision-notices/2013/801054/fs_50427906.pdf" class="theme-action" target="_blank"><h3 class="h4">Decision notice FS50427906</h3><div class="text-small"><p>PDF</p></div><span class="icon-file-pdf"><!-- required for FF3 and Opera --></span></a></li></ul></aside></li><li><div class="itemlink theme-action clearfix"><div class="itemlink-content"><h2 class="h3">Department for Social Development in Northern Ireland</h2><p class="text-small">25 February 2013, Central government</p> <p>The complainant has requested information relating to a terminated maintenance contract.

The Commissioner?s decision is that the Cabinet Office has not dealt with the complainant?s linked requests appropriately under the Act.  Specifically, the Cabinet Office breached section 1(1) - the Commissioner has found that the Cabinet did hold one document that fell within the scope of the 27 October request.  This document should have been disclosed. However, he found that the Cabinet Office held no further information.  He has not ordered a step in respect of this information as the complainant has provided clear evidence that she already has the document.

It cited section 29 (Prejudice to UK economic interests) and two parts of section 35 (Formulation/Development of government policy and Ministerial communications) as its reasons for doing so. It upheld this at internal review. It also introduced reliance on section 41 (Information provided in confidence) and section 43 (Prejudice to commercial interests) once the Commissioner?s investigation into this complaint had begun. At the same time, the Cabinet Office sought to rely on section 35(3) as a basis for refusing to confirm or deny whether it held any records of Cabinet discussions of the nationalisation of Bradford and Bingley.

The Commissioner?s decision is that the GAD was correct in stating that some information was not held, but that in relation to other information it was incorrect and in breach of section 1(1)(a) of the FOIA to state this. In relation to the citing of section 35(1)(a), the Commissioner finds that this exemption was not engaged and so it was cited incorrectly.

However, in relation to the Child Support Guide (Volume 7 revised edition) (Child Support Guide) he does not consider that the DWP has adequately complied with its duty under section 1(1)(a) of the FOIA. This is because the DWP informed the complainant that the information contained within the Child Support Guide was not held without taking reasonable steps to determine whether it held the information.

Subsequently the DECC contacted the complainant on several occasions and informed her (on each of these occasions) that it needed additional time in order to consider the public interest on this case.

In relation to section 42(1), the FCO maintained that this exemption applied. The Commissioner?s decision is that the FCO applied the exemption provided by section 42(1) correctly to all but one of the documents in relation to which it was cited. In relation to section 35(1)(a), the Commissioner finds that the response from the FCO did not meet the requirements of the FOIA. The Commissioner requires the public authority to disclose to the complainant the one document in relation to which the Commissioner has found that section 42(1) was not engaged and in relation to the information withheld from the previous requester under section 35(1)(a), respond to the complainant again with a confirmation or denial as to whether this information is held.

The Cabinet Office withheld all the information it held relevant to the request (four pieces of correspondence) claiming that all of it constituted the personal data of the specified individual. In addition, it applied the exemption for international relations (section 27) to two of the four documents. The complainant indicated to the Information Commissioner that he was content for any ?personal data? to be redacted from the withheld information. Therefore, where applied, the Information Commissioner will not consider further the exemption for personal information (section 40(2)). In respect of the exemption at section 27, the Information Commissioner has decided that the public authority properly applied this exemption and that the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosure. The Information Commissioner therefore requires the public authority to take the following steps to ensure compliance with the legislation: he orders that the content of the two emails previously withheld under the exemption for personal information should now be disclosed to the complainant, with the names of the parties redacted.</p><p class="text-small"><span class="dn-decision dn-decision-notupheld">FOI 27:<span>Not upheld</span></span><span class="dn-decision dn-decision-upheld">FOI 40:<span>Upheld</span></span></p></div></div><aside class="aside-further"><ul><li><a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/decision-notices/2012/717754/fs_50402016.pdf" class="theme-action" target="_blank"><h3 class="h4">Decision notice FS50402016</h3><div class="text-small"><p>PDF</p></div><span class="icon-file-pdf"><!-- required for FF3 and Opera --></span></a></li></ul></aside></li><li><div class="itemlink theme-action clearfix"><div class="itemlink-content"><h2 class="h3">Department for Culture Media and Sport</h2><p class="text-small">16 April 2012, Central government</p> <p>The complainant requested information in relation to the decision by Somerset County Council to close a number of libraries in the county.

The complainant asked the Commissioner to review the DfE?s handling of his request and provided the Commissioner with a copy of an email sent from a private email account.

The Commissioner has reviewed this email and found that whilst it was sent from a private email account it was held on behalf of the DfE for the purposes of the Act. By failing to disclose details of the email the DfE breached section 1 of the Act.

It reviewed the matter again once the Commissioner began his investigation. Following a further review, it stated that, in fact, it did not hold any unused photographs taken by Mr Parsons and that it had relied on section 36 in error. The Commissioner?s decision is that the Cabinet Office does not hold any unused photographs within the scope of the complainant?s request. However, it contravened the Act by failing to tell the complainant about this within 20 working days of his request. The Commissioner does not require the Cabinet Office to take any further steps in relation to its request.

It is my understanding that the UK goes not have a turbine manufacturer and ALL turbines are imported for assembly in the UK.  Taking this into account, what are the tax benefits to the UK economy with the importation of turbines?  The largest capital outlay for a commercial wind farm is some 75% for the purchasing and erecting of turbines with the remaining 25% for the preparation of the site.  a) What is the current tax benefit to the UK economy on the importation of wind turbines?; b) What is the annual tax benefit to the UK economy for wind turbines?  The ?benefit? does of course mean the direct income from turbines to the treasury in income tax, corporation tax etc; c) What tax benefits are awarded to wind farm operators on an annual basis?; d) What is the tax liability on an annual basis for individual commercial wind turbines? e) Is VAT applicable to wind turbines at any time?? The Information Commissioner?s decision is that HM Treasury dealt with the request under the wrong access regime. He considers that the request is for environmental information and should have been dealt with under the EIR, rather than the FOIA. He also considers that HM Treasury breached regulation 14(2) and 14(3)(a) of the EIR as it did not issue a valid refusal notice within 20 working days citing the exception it was relying on. The Information Commissioner (the Commissioner) contacted HM Treasury and asked it to provide a response to the complainant under the EIR. HM Treasury did so on 1 December 2011.

The complainant referred this matter to the Information Commissioner (?the Commissioner?). During the course of the Commissioner?s investigation, the DoH provided the complainant with some more information and explained that it now believed that the costs limit [section 12(1)] applied because it would require work beyond the costs limit to be certain to find all the information requested. The complainant then asked the Commissioner to issue a Decision Notice on specific problems with the DoH?s handling of his request. For those issues, the Commissioner has determined: the DoH?s response was delayed and it breached section 17(5) in not telling the complainant that it was relying on section 12(1) in 20 working days; the DoH also breached sections 1(1)(a) and 10(1) in wrongly declaring that it did not hold further relevant recorded information when it did; the advice and assistance provided by the DoH was not reasonable and it breached section 16(1); and the DoH wrongly argued that section 21(1) applied to the information behind links that didn?t work and so also breached sections 1(1)(b) and 10(1).

The Ministry of Justice (the ?MOJ?) responded and refused to answer a number of parts of the request on the basis that it did not consider them to be requests for recorded information. It also applied section 14(1) (vexatious request) but failed to specify which aspects of the request it was applying this to. It confirmed that it did not hold some of the information and advised the complainant to contact the Legal Services Commission for these aspects of the request. The subject matter of the case prompted the Information Commissioner to consider whether the MOJ should have considered section 40 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (?FOIA?) and given a ?neither confirm nor deny? response. He finds that confirmation or denial would disclose personal data and that the disclosure of this personal data would be in breach of the first data protection principle. The exemption provided by section 40(5)(b)(i) of the FOIA should therefore have been applied. The MOJ is not required to take any steps. The MOJ did, however, breach FOIA by responding to the request late. The MOJ must ensure that this delay is not repeated in future.

During the course of the Commissioner?s investigation the UKBA determined that it should primarily rely on section 31(1)(a) in order to withhold the requested information. It considered that its disclosure would be likely to prejudice the prevention and detection of crime. The Commissioner has decided that section 31(1)(a) is correctly applied to the information sought by the complainant and that the balance of public interest lies in favour of the maintaining this exemption.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office confirmed that it held five documents in total which came within scope of the request. A sixth document came to light during the course of the Commissioner?s investigation.  The Foreign and Commonwealth Office withheld five of the six documents under sections 27(1)(a) and 27(2).  In addition to these exemptions, the remaining document (a note of a telephone discussion between Prime Minister Blair and President Bush) was also withheld under section 35(1)(a).  During the course of the Commissioner?s investigation, the FCO disclosed five of the six documents to the complainant.  Latterly, the FCO confirmed that in addition to section 27, it was relying upon section 35(1)(b) (rather than 35(1)(a)) and, in the alternative, section 36 to withhold the note of the telephone conversation. The Commissioner decided that the withheld information was exempt under section 27 and that the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighed the public interest in disclosure of most of it. With regard to the remaining information (identified in the confidential annex to this Decision Notice) the Commissioner accepts that this information is exempt under both section 27 and section 35(1)(b), but considers that the balance of the public interest favours disclosure.

The GHACPW refused to provide the database on the basis that it was exempt from disclosure by virtue of section 43(2) of the Act. Following this refusal, and in response to an earlier decision notice issued by the Commissioner relating to a separate request by a different complainant, the GHACPW disclosed some parts of the database. By the time that this notice has been issued the complainant has therefore been able to access some of the information that he requested. (Furthermore, at the point at which this notice is being issued the GHACPW no longer exists with its functions and roles having been subsumed into the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). This notice is therefore being served on the FCO.) In respect of the remaining information that has not been disclosed, the Commissioner has concluded that some of this is exempt from disclosure on the basis of section 43(2); namely the original order number, cost per bottle, agency price and date each wine was ordered. However, the Commissioner has also concluded that the market price and stock held of each wine is not exempt from disclosure on the basis of section 43(2) and the FCO must therefore disclose this information.</p><p class="text-small"><span class="dn-decision dn-decision-upheld">FOI 10:<span>Upheld</span></span></p></div></div><aside class="aside-further"><ul><li><a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/decision-notices/2011/607628/fs_50347157.pdf" class="theme-action" target="_blank"><h3 class="h4">Decision notice FS50347157</h3><div class="text-small"><p>PDF</p></div><span class="icon-file-pdf"><!-- required for FF3 and Opera --></span></a></li></ul></aside></li><li><div class="itemlink theme-action clearfix"><div class="itemlink-content"><h2 class="h3">Cabinet Office</h2><p class="text-small">11 April 2011, Central government</p> <p>The complainant made a request to the Cabinet Office for recorded information it held in respect of the discussions between the Conservative and Liberal Democrat negotiating teams prior to the formation of the coalition government.

With reference to the first request, HMRC stated that it did not hold any specific information, a position that the Commissioner agrees with. In relation to the second request, HMRC considered that it had complied with the request by providing internally published guidance. The Commissioner, however, has found that the interpretation of the request adopted by HMRC was too narrow. Having reconsidered a broader interpretation of the request, HMRC has confirmed that it holds additional information which is relevant to the complainant?s request. However, due to the nature of the searches that would need to be undertaken to retrieve this information, HMRC estimated that the cost of compliance would exceed the appropriate limit for the purposes of section 12(1) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (the ?Act?). The Commissioner upholds HMRC?s application of section 12(1) but in not informing the complainant of this application it breached section 17(5). In failing to providing advice and assistance following its refusal under section 12(1) it also breached section 16(1). In relation to the first request the Commissioner also finds it breached section 10(1).

The public authority initially responded to the request under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and disclosed some of the requested information. Additional information was withheld under the exemptions in section 35(1)(a) (Formulation and development of government policy), section 42 (Legal professional privilege) and section 43(2) (Commercial interests). At the internal review stage the public authority referred to the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (EIR) and suggested that the withheld information would fall under the exceptions in regulation 12(4)(e) (Internal communications) and regulation 12(5)(b) (Course of justice, etc) if this legislation were to be applied. The Commissioner considers that the withheld information is environmental and that therefore the EIR was the correct regime to apply. However, the Commissioner also found that of the information identified by the public authority only a fraction fell within the scope of the request and that regulation 12(4)(e) was the only relevant exception. The Commissioner decided that this exception was only engaged for some of the information and that the public interest in maintaining the exception outweighed the public interest in disclosure.

He also finds that the public authority was incorrect to neither confirm nor deny that it holds any further information by virtue of section 44(2).

The Commissioner has provided the Cabinet Office with a number of opportunities to issue an appropriate response and it has failed to do so. The Commissioner finds that the Cabinet Office has breached a number of provisions of the Act. It has breached section 10(1) for failing to comply with its obligations under section 1 of the Act within the statutory timescales. It has breached section 17(1) in failing to issue a complete refusal notice in the statutory timescales. It has also breached section 17(1)(c) for failing to explain why the exemptions it cited applied. Finally, it breached section 17(3) for the unacceptable delay in communicating the results of its public interest determination. The Cabinet Office is required to issue a refusal notice to the requestor explaining why any exemption is engaged and where it believes the balance of the public interest lies.

The Commissioner did not look at section 27(1)(d) or section 43(2) as he was satisfied that other exemptions applied. The Commissioner also found that in its handling of the request the public authority breached section 1(1)(b) of the Act (General right of access to information held by public authorities); section 10(1) (Time for compliance) and section 17(1) (Refusal of a request).

The Commissioner investigated and was satisfied that some of the information was not held at the time of the request, although the public authority went on to obtain and provide this information on a goodwill basis, some of the information was already in the public domain and the remaining information could be provided following the refinement of the original request.

First Five Year Review which was approved by the Executive Committee of the NI Assembly (the Executive) in April 2008, or a list of the 157 changes which were made to the document when it was published in June 2008. The public authority confirmed that whilst it did not hold a list of the changes, it did hold a copy of the RDS document approved by the Executive but refused to provide it citing section 35(1)(b) of the Act. The Commissioner indicated to the public authority that the withheld information fell within the definition of environmental information under the EIR. However whilst the public authority appreciated the environmental nature of the information contained within the RDS document, it did not regard the focus of the complainant?s request to be environmental. The public authority was therefore content to continue to rely upon the exemption under s35 of the Act to refuse the information. The Commissioner found that the information requested was environmental information and should have been considered under the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (EIR) and, in failing to do so the public authority has breached regulation 5(2) of the EIR. The Commissioner requires the public authority to either provide the information or issue a valid refusal notice that complies with regulation 14 of the EIR within 35 days of the date of this notice.</p><p class="text-small"><span class="dn-decision dn-decision-upheld">EIR 5:<span>Upheld</span></span></p></div></div><aside class="aside-further"><ul><li><a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/decision-notices/2010/537852/FS_50227038.pdf" class="theme-action" target="_blank"><h3 class="h4">Decision notice FS50227038</h3><div class="text-small"><p>PDF</p></div><span class="icon-file-pdf"><!-- required for FF3 and Opera --></span></a></li></ul></aside></li><li><div class="itemlink theme-action clearfix"><div class="itemlink-content"><h2 class="h3">Department for Communities and Local Government</h2><p class="text-small">17 June 2010, Central government</p> <p>The complainant requested information held by DCLG relating to the Government decision to remove the 85 year rule from the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS).

The Commissioner is satisfied that DCLG applied section 42 correctly to the withheld information in relation to part 1 of his request. In respect of part 2 of the request the Commissioner decided that DCLG had failed to correctly cite section 42 which the Commissioner determined was not engaged. The Commissioner found that section 35 was engaged in respect of part 2 of his request for information about internal discussions but that the public interest in maintaining the exemption did not outweigh the public interest in disclosure.

The Cabinet Office are also in breach of section 17(1)(a), 17 (1)(b), 17 (1)(c) and 17(2) for failing to issue a refusal notice specifying an exemption it was relying on to withhold information or an estimate for the completion of the public interest test.</p><p class="text-small"><span class="dn-decision dn-decision-upheld">FOI 10:<span>Upheld</span></span><span class="dn-decision dn-decision-upheld">FOI 17:<span>Upheld</span></span></p></div></div><aside class="aside-further"><ul><li><a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/decision-notices/2010/533148/FS_50276849.pdf" class="theme-action" target="_blank"><h3 class="h4">Decision notice FS50276849</h3><div class="text-small"><p>PDF</p></div><span class="icon-file-pdf"><!-- required for FF3 and Opera --></span></a></li></ul></aside></li><li><div class="itemlink theme-action clearfix"><div class="itemlink-content"><h2 class="h3">Cabinet Office</h2><p class="text-small">27 May 2010, Central government</p> <p>On 3 March 2010 the complainant requested that the Cabinet Office should provide him with information concerning bonus payments to staff in the Office of the Third Sector.

It conducted a single internal review in relation to these two requests (and a third request) and confirmed its position. The Commissioner investigated and found that the public authority did not provide sufficient evidence for section 14(1) of the Act to be engaged in relation to these two requests. For each of the two requests, the public authority is required to confirm or deny to the complainant if the information requested is held and either disclose this information to the complainant or provide him with a valid refusal notice in accordance with the requirements of section 17(1) of the Act.

The public authority applied section 14 [vexatious requests] to the request. This meant it was not obliged to comply with section 1(1)(a) or (b). It upheld its position within its internal review. The complainant referred the case to the Commissioner. The Commissioner has considered this case and believes that three elements constituted requests for the complainant?s personal data and should have been considered separately under the Data Protection Act. Of the remaining five items, one was subsequently provided and he finds procedural breaches of sections 1(1)(a), 1(1)(b) and 10(1) for not confirming it was held or providing the information in 20 working days. For the final four elements he has studied the context and background in which the request was made and has determined that a reasonable public authority could have found these elements vexatious.

Finally the requestor sought details as to the measures taken by the CO to ensure that the correct version of the speech was distributed to MPs. The Cabinet Office confirmed to the complainant that the information was not held by the Prime Minister?s Office. This position was confirmed after an internal review. The Commissioner accepts that no information is held as to the reasons why the Prime Minister changed his speech from the previously prepared text to the actual speech given.

The public authority refused to disclose the information requested by the complainant citing sections 37(1)(a), 40(2) and 41(1) of the Act. The Commissioner has considered this case and has concluded that the complainant?s request clearly includes copies of correspondence between the public authority and The Prince of Wales and his representatives ? a point which was in dispute. However, in his request for an internal review the complainant clarified that he was not seeking the actual correspondence between the public authority and The Prince of Wales.  Therefore the Commissioner has not considered whether copies of this correspondence should be disclosed. During the course of the Commissioner?s investigation, the public authority informed him that it was willing to disclose to the complainant some of the information it had withheld. The Commissioner therefore requires this information to be disclosed to the complainant.  The Commissioner has concluded that the remaining information is exempt from disclosure on the basis of section 41(1) of the Act. Where such information constitutes environmental information as defined by the Environmental Information Regulations, the Commissioner is satisfied that such information is exempt from disclosure on the basis of the exception contained at regulation 12(5)(f).</p><p class="text-small"><span class="dn-decision dn-decision-upheld">EIR 14:<span>Upheld</span></span><span class="dn-decision dn-decision-upheld">EIR 14:<span>Upheld</span></span><span class="dn-decision dn-decision-upheld">EIR 14:<span>Upheld</span></span></p></div></div><aside class="aside-further"><ul><li><a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/decision-notices/2010/519134/FS_50130319.pdf" class="theme-action" target="_blank"><h3 class="h4">Decision notice FS50130319</h3><div class="text-small"><p>PDF</p></div><span class="icon-file-pdf"><!-- required for FF3 and Opera --></span></a></li></ul></aside></li><li><div class="itemlink theme-action clearfix"><div class="itemlink-content"><h2 class="h3">Cabinet Office</h2><p class="text-small">31 March 2010, Central government</p> <p>The complainant requested information held by the Cabinet Office concerning the Heir to the Throne, The Prince of Wales, remarrying after his divorce.

The DH initially refused to confirm or deny whether it held information falling within the scope of the request in reliance on section 37(2) of the Act ? communications with the Royal Household. During the course of the Commissioner?s investigations the DH confirmed to the complainant that it did hold information falling within the scope of his request.  The DH also reconsidered its approach to the complainant?s request and determined that it was not obliged to provide the information because to do so would exceed the appropriate cost limit under section 12(1) of the Act. The DH provided the Commissioner with documents containing information relevant to the complainant?s request. The Commissioner has determined that some of the information contained within them is environmental information and should therefore have been dealt with under the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (?the EIR?). For the information which is not environmental, the Commissioner has decided that the DH is entitled to refuse the complainant?s request on the basis that to comply with the request would exceed the appropriate limit and therefore section 12(1) of the Act applies. In respect of the environmental information, the Commissioner has decided that the DH is also entitled to refuse the request under regulation 12(4)(b) of the EIR on the basis that the request is manifestly unreasonable.

The Commissioner found that section 36(2)(c) was engaged  but decided that the public interest in maintaining the exemption did not outweigh the public interest in favour of disclosing of the information.

The information sought by the complainant relates to the undertaking given by Lord Ashcroft to take up residence in the UK prior to the award of his peerage. The complainant stressed that he did not want information relating to the suitability of Lord Ashcroft for the award; merely information which relates to his ?domicility? and tax status. The Cabinet Office confirmed that it held information relevant to the complainant?s request but determined that it should be withheld in reliance on the exemptions contained in sections 37(1)(b), 40(2) and 41 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (?the Act?). The Commissioner has decided that the Cabinet Office was wrong to rely on the exemptions provided by sections 37(1)(b), 40(2), 40(4) and 41 in order to withhold all of the information relevant to this request. The Commissioner finds that the disclosure of some limited information is warranted to serve the public interest in relation to section 37(1)(b) of the Act. He has also found that sections 40(2), 40(4) and 41 were not appropriately applied in respect of the limited information the Commissioner has identified for disclosure. In consequence of this finding the Commissioner has determined that the Cabinet Office breached section 1(1)(b) of the Act and he requires it to disclose information which is described in the confidential annex which is sent only to the Cabinet Office.

The Commissioner has concluded that some of the information which would fall within the scope of the complainant?s requests is environmental information as defined by the EIR. However, the Commissioner is satisfied that the DCMS is entitled to refuse to provide this environmental information because the requests are manifestly unreasonable. With regard to the non-environmental information the Commissioner is satisfied that to provide this information would exceed the cost limit at section 12(1).

Subsequent to the Commissioner?s intervention, the main body of the Tasker report was provided to the complainant?s satisfaction, subject to minor redactions in respect of section 40(2). However, during the course of the investigation the Ministry of Justice identified that it held further information in the form of seven annexes to the main report, which had been withheld from the complainant. It was very slow to supply the Commissioner with copies of the annexes, and it failed to identify to him which exemptions it was applying in respect of them. The Commissioner concluded that the annexes had not been included within the scope of the Ministry of Justice?s consideration of the request. In failing to issue a valid refusal notice in respect of the withheld annexes, the Commissioner therefore finds that the Ministry of Justice breached the time limit in section 17(1) of the Act. This Decision Notice therefore requires the Ministry of Justice to issue a refusal notice in compliance with section 17(1) in respect of the annexes. If the Ministry of Justice concludes that no exemption applies or if the exemption in question is qualified and the balance of the public interest favours disclosing the information, the annexes should be provided to the complainant.</p><p class="text-small"><span class="dn-decision dn-decision-upheld">FOI 17:<span>Upheld</span></span></p></div></div><aside class="aside-further"><ul><li><a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/decision-notices/2010/526190/FS_50208934.pdf" class="theme-action" target="_blank"><h3 class="h4">Decision notice FS50208934</h3><div class="text-small"><p>PDF</p></div><span class="icon-file-pdf"><!-- required for FF3 and Opera --></span></a></li></ul></aside></li><li><div class="itemlink theme-action clearfix"><div class="itemlink-content"><h2 class="h3">Home Office</h2><p class="text-small">2 March 2010, Central government</p> <p>The complainant submitted a number of requests to the Home Office which focused on correspondence which the Home Office may have exchanged with HRH The Prince of Wales and representatives of His Royal Highness.

The Northern Ireland Office (?NIO?) acknowledged the request and subsequently replied in June 2009 that section 27 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (the ?Act?) applied to some of the information. It went on to inform the complainant that it would carry out a public interest determination within a target timeframe. The Commissioner finds that sections 17(1) and 10(1) of the Act were breached at this stage as the public authority failed to inform the complainant that all the requested information was subject to an exemption within 20 working days. Furthermore, where the NIO stated that section 27 did apply, it did not specify the relevant sub-section of the exemption or give reasons setting out why the exemption was engaged, thereby breaching sections 17(1)(b) and 17(1)(c). The NIO subsequently adjusted its time frame to provide a substantive response on a number of separate occasions. The Commissioner has found the delay in carrying out a public interest assessment to be in breach of section 17(3)(b) of the Act. He therefore requires the public authority to issue a notice explaining why section 27 is engaged and where it believes the balance of the public interest lies.

The public authority divided the request into two parts. In response to the first part of the request, the public authority stated that it held no relevant information. In response to the second part of the request, the public authority confirmed that it held relevant information, but refused to disclose this, citing the exemption provided by section 35(1)(a) (formulation and development of government policy). The Commissioner finds that the public authority stated incorrectly that it held no information falling within the first part of the request, but that the information that it holds that falls within the scope of this part of the request is exempt by virtue of section 42(1) (legal professional privilege) and that the public interest in the maintenance of this exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosure. In relation to the second part of the request, the Commissioner finds that the exemption provided by section 35(1)(a) is engaged and that the public interest in the maintenance of the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosure.

The complainant specified the information he wanted to have, namely, the form in which the undertaking was given and identity of the person to whom it was given. The public authority confirmed that it held the information the complainant requested but determined that it should be withheld in reliance of the exemptions contained in sections 37(1)(b), 40(2) and 41 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (?the Act?). The Commissioner has decided that the Cabinet Office was wrong to rely on the exemptions provided by sections 37(1)(b), 40(2), 40(4) and 41 in order to withhold the requested information. In consequence of this, the Commissioner finds that the Cabinet office breached section 1(1)(b) of the Act. The Commissioner requires the Cabinet Office to disclose the information which it has improperly withheld.

The public authority initially applied a number of exemptions under the Freedom of Information Act (?the Act?) to the requested information. However, it also recognised that in the event that some of the information was environmental, a number of exceptions under the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (?the EIR?) would apply. During the course of the Commissioner?s investigation the public authority argued that some of the information it had initially considered to be relevant in fact fell outside of the scope of the request. The Commissioner has concluded that some of the information identified by the public authority did fall outside of the scope of the request but that other material fell within it. He has found that all of the information within the scope of the request should have been considered under the EIR and that some of it constitutes information on or relating to emissions. The Commissioner has concluded that the exceptions in Regulations 12(5)(e) to (g) cannot be relied upon as a basis for withholding the information by virtue of Regulation 12(9). In relation to the independent consultant reports, the Commissioner has found that they were incorrectly withheld on the basis of 12(4)(e) as they do not constitute internal communications. The Commissioner has concluded that the remainder of the withheld information did constitute internal communications and therefore the exception in Regulation 12(4)(e) was engaged. However, he has found that the public interest in maintaining this exception at the time of the request did not outweigh the public interest in disclosure. The Commissioner also finds that disclosure of personal data identified by the public authority would not have breached the data protection principles and therefore Regulation 13(1) did not apply. The Commissioner has ordered the public authority to disclose the information within the scope of the request that has not already been provided to the complainant within 35 days from the date of this Notice.

During the course of the Commissioner?s investigation, HMRC additionally cited sections 40 (personal information) and 44 (prohibitions on disclosure) in relation to some of the withheld information.

As the information withheld under section 40 was also withheld under section 44, having found section 44 engaged, the Commissioner has not considered the application of section 40.
