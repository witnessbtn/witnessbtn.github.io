	<p><span class="text-uppercase">Hundreds of millions</span> of pounds worth of property in Brighton and Hove, including Churchill Square, is held by companies registered in tax havens, <span class="font-italic">Witness</span> can reveal.</p>
<p>Data from HM Land Registry shows that 574 of the 611 offshore owned properties in Brighton are held by companies registered in countries recognised by the IMF as offshore financial centres, as of April 2018.</p>
<p>Buildings held offshore include Churchill Square, Waitrose, Ye Old King and Queen, MyHotel, the Hippodrome on Middle Street, Travelodge on Preston Road and other prime retail space along Western Road.</p>
<p>Although there is no suggestion of illegality, the offshore status of these properties may have allowed their owners to avoid paying significant amounts in UK tax.</p>
<p>Most of the property owned by offshore companies is residential rather than commercial, and the full list includes new and old buildings. 78 of the newly built apartments along the Brighton Marina boardwalk in Kemptown have been snapped up by offshore firms since 2016.</p>
<img src="/lloyd.png" style="width:100%;" class="img-responsive" />
<p class="small text-right text-dark">Lloyd Russel Moyle, MP for Brighton Kemptown, says more should be done to tackle tax avoidance.</p>
<p>Labour MP for Brighton Kemptown Lloyd Russell-Moyle said “It’s clearly a sign that Brighton, just like London, is becoming infested with people who see property not as a place to live, but as gold bullion on our streets as investments.</p>
<p>“There is an issue in Brighton that we have a housing crisis, that we have huge amounts of homeless people, and then, rich people who often have no connection with the city are coming in, snapping up properties.</p>
<p>“They snap them up through a network of offshore companies so they don't have to pay tax, and sometimes they use them explicitly to launder money. It is immoral, because it deprives people of homes they need to live in and Brightonians are pushed further and further out of our city.”</p>

<p>Despite parliament currently taking measures to improve transparency in offshore tax havens by enforcing open property registers in British Overseas Territories, the move will only affect 38% of Brighton-based property held in tax havens.</p>
<p>Mr Russell-Moyle said that the bill would make a big change, but won’t stop the problem completely. </p>
<p>“Two things were intended to happen with some of the more open registers: one is you can actually see who owns these companies, and if you can see who owns them you can make sure they are paying the right amount of tax. </p>
<p>“Secondly, there is a large suspicion that property is used to launder money, and so knowing who owns them and checking their money is decent will be a start. But at the moment the government do hardly any enforcement,” he said.</p>
<p>192 properties in Brighton and Hove are owned by firms registered in Jersey, and 154 are owned by companies registered in the British Virgin Islands. The offshore company which owns the most property in Brighton and Hove is the Jersey-based Anstone Estates Limited, which owns 43 residential flats on London Road.</p>
<p>The value of properties totals at least £214,614,877, however this is likely to be much higher, as sale value data was only held for 39% of properties.</p>
<h2>What is being done about it?</h2>
<p>THERE IS NO suggestion that the foreign companies are acting illegally, but their overseas status may have helped reduce their inheritance tax, stamp duty, capital gains tax and income tax over the years.</p>
<p>A lack of scrutiny and a culture of secrecy in tax havens mean that they could also be used by criminal organisations to launder money through the UK property market.</p>
<p>The government announced plans to close one loophole last year, meaning that non-UK residents could no longer avoid inheritance tax by owning residential property in the UK through an offshore company. However, many offshore jurisdictions still offer greater secrecy to people who purchase property through a company rather than as an individual.</p>
<p>The Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Bill currently going through Parliament aims to change that. It will increase transparency in tax havens, by forcing British Overseas Territories to publish the details of the owners of companies based there. However, it won’t cover Jersey, Guernsey or the Isle of Man, meaning that it would only affect 38% of tax haven owned property in Brighton and Hove.</p>
